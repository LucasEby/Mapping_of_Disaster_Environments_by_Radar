# How to check what port Mac is connected to:
#       https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/arduinoio/ug/find-arduino-port-on-windows-mac-and-linux.html

# ^ Without the "", the terminal command is: "ls /dev/*"
# The port your Arduino is connected to starts with "/dev/tty.usbmodem*" or "/dev/tty.usbserial*".
#       (The port number is the *).

import serial
import time

ser = serial.Serial('/dev/tty.usbserial-DN051AHX')  # open serial port
print(ser.name)         # check which port was really used (not really needed)

# For loop to test a series of messages. Ideally we should test exactly how fast we can send and receive messages.
ser.write(b'hello')     # write a string
time.sleep(2) # sleep for 2 seconds


ser.close()             # close port
